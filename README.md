# TypeScript Assignment: Understanding Type Aliases, Interfaces, Callback Functions, and Objects

## Introduction

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language. It helps in catching errors early through a type system. This assignment will guide you through understanding and implementing some fundamental concepts in TypeScript such as type aliases, interfaces, callback functions, and objects.

### Objective

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Define and use type aliases in TypeScript.
2. Create and implement interfaces in TypeScript.
3. Understand and write callback functions in TypeScript.
4. Work with objects in TypeScript, including defining and using custom types.

### Theoretical Task: 

### Difference Between Type Alias and Interface

### Practical Tasks

#### Part 1: Type Aliases

**Task:** Create a type alias named `StringOrNumber` that can accept either a string or a number.

#### Part 2: Interfaces

**Task:** Define an interface named `Person` with properties `name` (string) and `age` (number). Then, create an object `john` that implements this interface.

#### Part 3: Callback Functions

**Task:** Write a function named `processData` that takes two parameters: an array of data (`data`) and a callback function (`callback`). The `callback` function should take one parameter and return nothing. Inside `processData`, call the `callback` function with the first element of the `data` array.

#### Part 4: Working with Objects

**Task:** Define a custom type named `Address` with properties `street`, `city`, and `zip`. Then, create an object `myAddress` of type `Address`.


## Submission Guidelines

1. Execute each task in your TypeScript development environment.
2. Store your code in a file named `assignment.ts`.
3. Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc assignment.ts`).
4. Submit both the compiled JavaScript file (`assignment.js`) and your original TypeScript source file (`assignment.ts`) via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/sGi9hgeT25TBQxtr9).


### Grading Criteria

- **Correctness:** Does the code correctly implement the required functionality?
- **Readability:** Is the code easy to read and understand?
- **Completion:** Have all parts of the assignment been completed?

Good luck
